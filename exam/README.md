3. Flask
4. Go
5. Gin
6. Java
7. Spring
8. Docker/Docker Compose
9. SonarQube
10. Rsyslog
11. Git

## Preparing for running

### Install Java
Install package:
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
    or
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre
Then add in the end of the .bashrc file:
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_221/
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

### Install PostgreSQL
    sudo su postgres
    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    createuser sonar
    psql
    ALTER USER sonar WITH ENCRYPTED password '<YOUR PASSWORD>';
    CREATE DATABASE sonar OWNER sonar;
    \q

### System settings
    sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group --disabled-login sonarqube
    sudo mkdir /opt/sonarqube
    sudo mkdir /opt/sonarscanner

### Install Docker
    sudo apt install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
    sudo apt update && apt-cache policy docker-ce
    sudo apt install -y docker-ce
    sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

### Install Docker Compose
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose
	
### Install SonarQube
Go to [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/) and download Community Edition. After that type some commands:
    

### Install Jenkins

## Installing Jobs
Installing job going manually from the `/jobs` directory.  
You need to get access to your Linux server by **SSH** or something, upload xml files from the mentioned above directory into:  
`/var/lib/jenkins/jobs`

## Java Containers
1st image for Java weighs - 441Mb. That image is considering for good JVM memory management using start container command like that:  
`docker run -it --rm --name webserver -m 2Gb spring_hello exec java -Xmx1024m -cp . -jar /deployments/hello-0.0.1.jar`
2nd image for Java weighs - 168Mb. It's from Java 11 and Alpine, start container command:  
`docker run -d -p 8083:8080 -t spring_hello:0.0.1`

## Using

### Continuous Integration
This is the part about code linting, build, test and getting results back into Git service.  
As a Git service used Github right now.  
It's useful at the moment of Pull Request/Code review. It doesn't lead to deploy actually.  
You just need to push some code on the Git service to start a job.

### Continuous Delivery
This is the part about deploy.  
Checking for changes in the ***dev*** branch going every 5 minutes.  
If new changes appeared, Jenkins will start the job. It has linting, build, test, deploy stages.
You need to merge Pull Request into ***dev*** branch to get a job started.

### Troubleshooting
I had encountered with some troubles:  
1. No way to install Golang later version than 1.10.4 on **Ubuntu 18.04**. Which makes impossible to run Gin there.  
I avoided that problem using CentOS instead. Docker **golang:latest** image is better option.
2. There're some issues with installing SonarQube locally.  
I solved these issues by installing Docker Compose and using SonarQube in a Docker image.

### Further development
* If I had enough time, I would replace Github by Gitlab.
* If I had enough time, I would make Docker containers management - Kubernetes or Swarm.
