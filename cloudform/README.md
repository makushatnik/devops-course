# The AWS CloudFormation case.

Network CloudFormation case.

## Preparing.
You need at least 1 CloudFormation Stack at your AWS account.

## Running.
Go to your AWS console and upload an `infra.yml` as a CloudFormation Template.  
If there's no errors, all the infrastructure will be created. You could test it by SSH connections then.
